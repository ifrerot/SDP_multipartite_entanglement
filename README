This repository provides a code to test the compatibility of a dataset of correlation functions with a separable quantum state (more precisely, the code tests a semidefinite positive relaxation to this problem). It is capable of addressing a general scenario, namely involving N qudits with m measurement settings, although the Notebook only addresses the case of qubits with Pauli measurements. Thanks to its efficient scaling, it is particularly suited for implementation in scenarios with a high number of parties and/or measurements. The method can be seen as an instance of Lasserre relaxation to the classical moment problem. It provides an estimation of robustness to white noise and extraction of an entanglement witness.

The file entanglement_tools.py contains the functions related to generating examplary data and the SDP, and analyzing the solution, and a notebook is provided to show an example.
